### Options

* End-to-end neural network
  * Run the simulator with the "perfect" driver. Collect the images and the steering angle.
  * Create a network based on VGG
  * Error function.
  * Training
* Actor/Critic
* Segmentation

### Notes

* If you want to compile for yourself, use /home/gym_torcs/vtorcs-RL-color/src/libs/raceengineclient/raceengine.cpp
* to get from little screen to big screen: down, down, enter; down, enter; right, right, enter; enter
* run with command line --random option to enable random track selector

### todo
* preprocess image, image augmentation,  road segmentation
* test network and solver
* adjust hyperparameters
